## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Manual inspections on manufacturing lines are inefficient, slow, and prone to human error. We propose a universal solution for quality inspections using object detection models, capable of detecting defects and classifying objects with precision.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project leverages advanced object detection techniques to analyze test data, detect defects, and classify objects. The output is a video highlighting **defective materials with red borders** and **good materials with green borders**.

**Key Technologies**:
- **Object Detection** (YOLO)
- **Machine Learning** (TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Computer Vision** (OpenCV)
- **Data Manipulation** (NumPy, Pandas)

---
## 📽️ **Dataset Overview**

The dataset is consisting of two parts.
Top Part: Consists of the video of assembly line.
Bottom Part: Consists of a binary representation of defects if any for the above video. (Black for no defects and White for defects)
This can be used for generating the dataset further for classification of the objects into defective and non defecting.

1. **Data Input**: The model accepts training and test data.
2. **Image Processing**: The images are split into two parts:
    - Original Image
    - Binary Image
3. **Object Identification**: Object detection is applied to both original and binary images.
4. **Defect Masking**: Using binary images, objects with defects are selected and masked.
5. **Model Training**: The processed data is used to train the model.
6. **Defect Detection on Test Data**: The trained model detects defects in new test data.
7. **Output Generation**: A video is produced, visually differentiating good (green border) and bad (red border) materials.
